FCC JS Date Object - Building Date Formatter

content:
- Constructor
  > In JavaScript, there are many built-in constructors that create objects. A constructor is like a regular function, but starts with a capital letter, and is initialized with the new operator.

- Date Object
  > Build in object from JS to help manipulate with Date related stuff

- date.getDate();
  > One of those is the .getDate() method, which returns a number between 1 and 31 that represents the day of the month for that date.
  > ex: 
  const date = new Date();
  const dayOfTheMonth = date.getDate();
  console.log(dayOfTheMonth);

- date.getMonth();
  > The .getMonth() method returns a number between 0 and 11. This represents the month for the date provided, where 0 is January and 11 is December. Because the number this method returns is zero-based, you need to add 1 to it to get the expected month number.

- date.getYear()
  > The .getFullYear() method returns a number which represents the year for the provided date.

- date.getHours();
  > The .getHours() method returns a number between 0 and 23. This represents the hour for the provided date, where 0 is midnight and 23 is 11 p.m.

- date.getMinutes();
  > The .getMinutes() method returns a number between 0 and 59 which represents the minutes for the provided date.

- JavaScript change
  > In JavaScript, the change event is used to detect when the value of an HTML element has changed
  > The change event is fired for <input>, <select>, and <textarea> elements when the user modifies the element's value. Unlike the input event, the change event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's value.
  > Can be used for select option input
  > ex: 
  element.addEventListener("change", () => {});

- switch
  > A switch statement is used to compare an expression against multiple possible values and execute different code blocks based on the match. It's commonly used for branching logic.
  > ex:
  switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case 1:
      console.log("It's Monday!");
      break;
    case 2:
      console.log("It's Tuesday!");
      break;
    // ...cases for other workdays
    default:
      console.log("It's the weekend!");
  }
